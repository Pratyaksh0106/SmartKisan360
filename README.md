🌾 SmartKisan360
SmartKisan360 is an AI-powered farmer intelligence platform built for the AWS AI for Bharat Hackathon. It leverages Amazon Bedrock (GenAI), AWS S3, and EC2 to help farmers make data-driven decisions across the crop lifecycle — from crop planning and yield prediction to market price insights and selling guidance. The prototype uses public/synthetic data and is designed for scalable, rural-first deployment.
